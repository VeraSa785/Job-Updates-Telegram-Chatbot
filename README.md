# ðŸ¤– Job Updates Telegram Chatbot

Welcome to my first Telegram Chatbot project! The chatbot's primary purpose is to simplify the job hunting process by monitoring job listings on **Smartsheet** and **Remitly** websites. Specifically, it's designed to exclude certain roles such as "Senior", "Software Engineer II", "Engineer III", "Manager", and "Principal", aligning with a customer's specific request.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- Monitors job postings from Smartsheet and Remitly in real-time.
- Excludes specific job roles: "Senior", "Software Engineer II", "Engineer III", "Manager", and "Principal".
- Sends instant alerts with job details and a direct link to the job listing when a new job is posted.

## ðŸ’» Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Telegram API token

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies

- aiogram
- asyncio
- dotenv

## ðŸš€ Setup and Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine.
